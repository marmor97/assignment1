```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
pacman::p_load(ggplot2)
```

```{r}
hello <- c(1,2,3)
my_name_is <- c("marie","frida", "guscode")
df <- data.frame(hello, my_name_is)
ggplot(df, aes(hello, my_name_is)) + geom_point()
```


```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
